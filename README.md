# NanoHabits AI

**NanoHabits AI** is a minimalist, cross-platform habit tracker powered by AI. It helps users break down their big goals into small, actionable habits — the nano building blocks of personal growth.

## 🧠 Concept

NanoHabits AI is built on a simple idea:

> "Tiny consistent actions, powered by smart feedback, lead to lasting transformation."

## 🎨 Design & Branding

NanoHabits embraces a clean, calming aesthetic:

- **Theme**: Minimalist dark mode (inspired by Notion, Linear)
- **Visual Identity**:
  - Dot motifs (nano actions)
  - Abstract cheese icons (symbolizing rewards and habit loops)
